## About This Blog

Hi there! Welcome to **Cracking Coding Challenge**, a blog I created as part of a midterm project for my class. The assignment asked us to come up with a meaningful title and niche for our website, and I decided to focus on something close to my heart: coding challenges.

This blog is my way of sharing what I’ve learned while solving coding problems online. I know how overwhelming coding can feel, especially when you’re starting out, but I believe with the right guidance, anyone can improve and feel more confident.

### Why I Chose This Niche

I titled the blog **Cracking Coding Challenge** because it reflects my goal of breaking down coding problems into simpler, manageable steps. The blog focuses on solving and reviewing coding challenges from popular platforms like HackerRank and LeetCode.

I chose this niche because coding interviews often involve similar problems. By practicing these challenges, you can build problem-solving skills and gain confidence for real-world coding scenarios.

### What You’ll Find

Here’s what I aim to offer through this blog:

- **Clear Step-by-Step Solutions**: I break down each problem into easy-to-follow steps, so it’s approachable for anyone, even if you’re a beginner.
- **Simplified Explanations**: I make it a point to explain solutions in plain language, free from unnecessary jargon.
- **Tips for Best Practices**: Learn practical coding techniques to help you write cleaner, more efficient code.

### Explore Categories

To make it easier for you to navigate, I’ve organized the blog into these main sections:

- **HackerRank**: My insights and solutions to challenges on HackerRank.
- **LeetCode**: Detailed problem-solving guides for LeetCode’s popular questions.
- **Best Practices**: Tips and tricks to help you improve your coding style and efficiency.

### Why This Blog Is Worth Following

Whether you’re a complete beginner trying to learn the ropes or someone brushing up on skills for a coding interview, this blog is here to help. I’ll keep it updated with new challenges and insights, so you’ll always find something fresh to learn.
