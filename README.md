# Welcome to Cracking Coding Challenge

This repository contains my blog, which I created as part of my midterm project for class. The assignment required us to think critically about a title and niche for our website blog, and I decided to focus on coding challenges.

## What Is This Blog About?

I started this blog because I wanted to share my experiences and insights while tackling online coding problems. Coding can sometimes feel overwhelming, especially for beginners, and I hope this blog can help make it a little easier for anyone trying to improve their skills.

### Title and Niche

The title of my blog, **Cracking Coding Challenge**, reflects my goal of helping others navigate and solve various coding problems. The niche I’ve chosen is centered around solving and reviewing online coding challenges, specifically focusing on popular platforms like HackerRank and LeetCode. This niche is important to me because coding interviews often include similar challenges, and I believe mastering these problems can significantly boost confidence and skill in programming.
